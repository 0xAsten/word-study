# Word Study Extension

The Word Study Extension is a Chrome extension that allows users to enter English words and receive a list of sentences using those words as output. The sentences are generated using the GPT-3 API.

## Getting Started

To use the extension, you'll need to have a GPT-3 API key. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website. Once you have your API key, save it to Word Study Extension:

## Usage

To use the extension, click on the icon in the Chrome toolbar. Enter one or more English words into the input field and click the "Submit" button. The extension will generate a list of sentences using those words and display them in the output area.
